# Proposal
I want to make the goblin simulator project I did for the state scene assignment into a full fledged game
of course, it's going to be a totally separate game, but it would be heavily based off of the original.

It would hopefully be equipped with music, more characters, actually good drawings, minigames, and more than two and a half endings.

## What I Need
- Storyline
- New Drawings
- Good Text Box Understanding

## What I Want
- Minigames
- Actually Good Drawings
